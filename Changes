0.03    2015-04-06 (PERLANCAR)

	- Do rm -rf & add warning [GH#1]
	      
	      Instead of searching for old share files from 'git log',
	  simply nuke the
	      target's per-dist share dir before installation. This is
	  simpler, can clean
	      newer files when user downgrade to an older version, and
	  doesn't require git.
